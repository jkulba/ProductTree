# ProductTree: AstroJS + Markdown Documentation Solution
## Presentation Outline

---

## 1. Opening Hook (2 minutes)
### Problem Statement
- **Current State**: Scattered documentation across wikis, SharePoint, Confluence, README files
- **Pain Points**: 
  - Hard to find information when systems are down
  - Inconsistent formatting and structure
  - No single source of truth
  - Documentation gets stale quickly
- **The Question**: "How many times this week did you struggle to find the right runbook or documentation?"

---

## 2. The Solution Overview (3 minutes)
### AstroJS + Markdown = Perfect Documentation Stack
- **One Platform**: All technical docs, runbooks, and procedures in one place
- **Developer-Friendly**: Markdown = version control, diff tracking, PR reviews
- **Fast & Modern**: AstroJS delivers lightning-fast static sites
- **Maintainable**: Easy to update, search, and organize

### Live Demo Teaser
- Show the ProductTree site running locally
- Highlight clean navigation, search functionality, responsive design

## 3. The Magic: Prompt Engineering with XML (5 minutes)
### Why XML Format Matters
```xml
<prompt>
    <task>Generate AstroJs website to host markdown documentation</task>
    <context>
        <owner>Hallcrest Engineering</owner>
        <subject>Product Support Documentation</subject>
    </context>
    <!-- ... structured requirements ... -->
</prompt>
```

### Key Benefits of XML Prompts:
1. **Precision**: Clear, unambiguous instructions for AI
2. **Reusability**: Prompt becomes a reusable template
3. **Version Control**: Check prompts into git alongside code
4. **Team Collaboration**: Share and iterate on prompts
5. **Documentation**: The prompt itself documents the requirements

### Live Demo: Copilot in Action
- Show the original XML prompt
- Demonstrate how it generated the entire site structure
- Highlight the comprehensive output from a single prompt
